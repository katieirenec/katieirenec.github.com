title: Rubber ducks and research 
---

I am starting my second semester as a PhD student at Georgia Tech, working on computing education research with advisor Mark Guzdial. Atlanta has extremely variable weather, and so fog is not nearly as common as in Monterey County. With that in mind, I needed to change the theme of the blog... but to what? 

Rubber ducks and rubber duck de-bugging were a theme I integrated into my TA training programs, to emphasize the use of student self-explanation (rather than TA-led explanation) while TAs did their jobs. I gave out little rubber ducks during TA orientation each semester, and always made sure a duck was present in the student computing lab at Cal State Monterey Bay.

I think that the rubber duck also connects nicely to my current research interests. At the moment, I am investigating student "sketching" or "doodling" techniques and what they might reflect about students' understanding of the notional machine. Creating a sketch of code execution presents an opportunity to refine understanding of the notional machine, and also feels very similar to explaining code to that handy rubber duck.

Here's to a great new semester and to some great new research!
