<!-- ## Research -->

Kathryn "Katie" Cunningham studies the way novices learn to program, and invents new methods for teaching computing. 

Using *human-centered computing methods* in the context of *computer science education*, her research improves learners’ motivation and cognition while learning programming, with a long-term goal of broadening pathways to computing education.

Dr. Cunningham's current focus is on understanding and supporting novice learners with diverse goals, and developing new software-supported scaffolding that allows learners to focus on code’s purpose.
