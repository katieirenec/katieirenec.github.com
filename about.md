## Hey! I'm Katie Cunningham.

I am currently a PhD student focusing on [Computing Education Research](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/cer). I am in the [Human-Centered Computing program](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/academics/degree-programs/phd/human-centered-computing) at Georgia Tech, working with advisor [Mark Guzdial](https://twitter.com/guzdial). I am interested in how students understand the notional machine, and how techniques like sketching and testing can help improve that understanding.

Previously, I was the Computer Science Education Coordinator at Cal State Monterey Bay and Hartnell College. I worked closely with students from the Salinas Valley to ensure they obtain the education they need to compete for top opportunities in software engineering and other computing careers. I developed and managed many programs to achieve this goal, including [TA++](https://sites.google.com/a/csumb.edu/taplusplus/), [Peer-Led Team Learning](https://sites.google.com/a/csumb.edu/cs-pltl/what-is-pltl), and [Cohort Enrichment](https://sites.google.com/a/csumb.edu/fys-cs/).

Before that, I was an undergraduate at the University of Arizona, where I studied Computer Science, Molecular and Cellular Biology, and Math. I also participated in multiple research projects, was president of the [Women in Computer Science Club](http://www.cs.arizona.edu/wics/), and led community projects for local refugee kids with the Honors Civic Engagement Teams.

I believe strongly in the power of high-quality computer science education as a force for economic mobility. My hands-on experience has deepened my belief that improved computer science instruction has an incredible effect, and that instruction firmly grounded in the science of how people learn and validated by research is urgently needed. I want to contribute to this effort by pursuing computer science education research.
