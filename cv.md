### PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE:  
*Computer Science Education Coordinator, California State University Monterey Bay, July 2013-June 2016* 
 
 * Evaluate, mentor, and support community college and university students seeking an accelerated Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (CSin3). 
 * Supervise, train, and develop curriculum for 22 computer science tutors who lead weekly collaborative problem-solving workshops targeting conceptual understanding and common misconceptions.

### RESEARCH EXPERIENCE:   

*Pushing programming plans into context, Fall 2017-present*

- How can we modernize the idea of "programming plans" for use by today's novice programmers? 

*Sketching and tracing on introductory programming problems, Fall 2016-present*

- Evaluated student sketching behavior among introductory programming students, and its correlation with correct program tracing.
- Replicated earlier work determining that drawing traces of memory states is the sketching technique more correlated with success on code reading problems. 
- Found that students who started but did not finish a sketched trace performed most poorly. 

*Interactive ebooks for AP CSP, Spring 2017*

- Managed 17 undergraduate researchers in the development and evaluation of ebooks for AP Computer Science Principles. Changes included improved accessibility through interface changes to the Runestone platform, new content including practice tests, and suggestions for future improvements.

*Faster Optimization for ∂a∂i, University of Arizona Molecular and Cellular Biology, Summer 2012-Spring 2013*  

- Developed strategies to improve nonlinear optimization routines for the open source demographic inference software package ∂a∂i, with a focus on tweaking SciPy’s BFGS algorithm for ∂a∂i’s objective function.  
- Benchmarked the performance of optimizers for typical ∂a∂i models and data, and fit demographic inference models for African populations.  

*New Gene Microarray Clustering Techniques, University of Pittsburgh TECBio REU, Summer 2011*  

- Utilized k-means clustering and Markov blankets to predict connections between gene microarray data and visual traits of liver tumors.  
- Implemented the Partition Decoupling Method in MATLAB, and utilized it to compare the effects of microRNA regulatory elements and transcription factor regulatory elements.  

*Epigenetics of Asthma Analysis, University of Arizona Computer Science, Spring 2011*
  
- Developed a C program that locates genes, regulatory elements, and CpG islands that overlap genetic regions of interest.  
- Consulted in the development of an integer linear programming algorithm examining the relation of methylation levels across the genome to asthma prevalence.  

*[Lombardi Graph Drawing](http://lombardi.cs.arizona.edu/), University of Arizona Computer Science, Spring-Fall 2011*  

 * Developed a force-directed algorithm for visualizing graphs with perfect angular resolution and circular arcs. Implemented our algorithm and another proposed algorithm in Python.   

*Utility of "Flats" Calibration in Extrasolar Planet Detection, University of Arizona Astronomy Club, Fall 2011*  

 * Performed statistical analysis of the effects of telescope calibration on extrasolar planet detection, using R. Determined that “flat” calibrations had no significant effect on signal-to-noise ratio, saving the team hours in telescope calibration time.

*[LoCuS Labs for Computer Science](http://www.cs.arizona.edu/projects/focal/ergalics/fieldguide/), University of Arizona Computer Science, Summer 2010*  

 * Conceptualized and developed extendable virtual notebook system that can be customized with quizzes, images, and interactive activities, with feedback from K12 teachers. Programming was done in Java.

### TEACHING EXPERIENCE:  
*Instructor, Cohort Enrichment - Year 1, CSin3 program, Hartnell College, Fall 2013-Present*  

 * Lead three-hour weekly session for freshmen that covers programming fundamentals, study skills, teambuilding, culture building, career exploration, and resume creation.  
 * Guide Peer Instruction and pair programming activities at the introductory programming level.

*Instructor, Data Structures Boot Camp, CSin3 program, Hartnell College, Summer 2015*  
  
 * Taught intensive 2-week boot camp on data structures basics, including binary search, Big-O, linked lists, stacks, queues, and recursion.  
 * Utilized active lecture style featuring Peer Instruction. All assignments incorporated unit testing.

*Teaching Assistant, [300-level quantitative biology course](http://gutengroup.mcb.arizona.edu/mcb-315/), University of Arizona, Spring and Fall 2012*  

 * Held weekly office hours, often with an emphasis on MATLAB help.  
 * Developed answer sets and graded homework assignments.  
 * Created MATLAB tutorials accessible to students without programming experience.  

*Director, Women in Computer Science’s programming classes for non-majors, Spring 2012*  

 * Supervised 11 WiCS members to advertise, plan, and teach basic programming in Python, Java, and C over multiple weekend workshops.
