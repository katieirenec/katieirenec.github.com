### PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE:  
*Computer Science Education Coordinator, California State University Monterey Bay, July 2013-June 2016* 
 
 * Evaluate, mentor, and support community college and university students seeking an accelerated Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (CSin3). 
 * Supervise, train, and develop curriculum for 22 computer science tutors who lead weekly collaborative problem-solving workshops targeting conceptual understanding and common misconceptions.

### RESEARCH EXPERIENCE:   
*Faster Optimization for ∂a∂i, University of Arizona Molecular and Cellular Biology, Summer 2012-Spring 2013*  

- Developed strategies to improve nonlinear optimization routines for the open source demographic inference software package ∂a∂i, with a focus on tweaking SciPy’s BFGS algorithm for ∂a∂i’s objective function.  
- Benchmarked the performance of optimizers for typical ∂a∂i models and data, and fit demographic inference models for African populations.  

*New Gene Microarray Clustering Techniques, University of Pittsburgh TECBio REU, Summer 2011*  

- Utilized k-means clustering and Markov blankets to predict connections between gene microarray data and visual traits of liver tumors.  
- Implemented the Partition Decoupling Method in MATLAB, and utilized it to compare the effects of microRNA regulatory elements and transcription factor regulatory elements.  

*Epigenetics of Asthma Analysis, University of Arizona Computer Science, Spring 2011*
  
- Developed a C program that locates genes, regulatory elements, and CpG islands that overlap genetic regions of interest.  
- Consulted in the development of an integer linear programming algorithm examining the relation of methylation levels across the genome to asthma prevalence.  

*[Lombardi Graph Drawing](http://lombardi.cs.arizona.edu/), University of Arizona Computer Science, Spring-Fall 2011*  

 * Developed a force-directed algorithm for visualizing graphs with perfect angular resolution and circular arcs. Implemented our algorithm and another proposed algorithm in Python.   

*Utility of "Flats" Calibration in Extrasolar Planet Detection, University of Arizona Astronomy Club, Fall 2011*  

 * Performed statistical analysis of the effects of telescope calibration on extrasolar planet detection, using R. Determined that “flat” calibrations had no significant effect on signal-to-noise ratio, saving the team hours in telescope calibration time.

*[LoCuS Labs for Computer Science](http://www.cs.arizona.edu/projects/focal/ergalics/fieldguide/), University of Arizona Computer Science, Summer 2010*  

 * Conceptualized and developed extendable virtual notebook system that can be customized with quizzes, images, and interactive activities, with feedback from K12 teachers. Programming was done in Java.

### TEACHING EXPERIENCE:  
*Instructor, Cohort Enrichment - Year 1, CSin3 program, Hartnell College, Fall 2013-Present*  

 * Lead three-hour weekly session for freshmen that covers programming fundamentals, study skills, teambuilding, culture building, career exploration, and resume creation.  
 * Guide Peer Instruction and pair programming activities at the introductory programming level.

*Instructor, Data Structures Boot Camp, CSin3 program, Hartnell College, Summer 2015*  
  
 * Taught intensive 2-week boot camp on data structures basics, including binary search, Big-O, linked lists, stacks, queues, and recursion.  
 * Utilized active lecture style featuring Peer Instruction. All assignments incorporated unit testing.

*Teaching Assistant, [300-level quantitative biology course](http://gutengroup.mcb.arizona.edu/mcb-315/), University of Arizona, Spring and Fall 2012*  

 * Held weekly office hours, often with an emphasis on MATLAB help.  
 * Developed answer sets and graded homework assignments.  
 * Created MATLAB tutorials accessible to students without programming experience.  

*Director, Women in Computer Science’s programming classes for non-majors, Spring 2012*  

 * Supervised 11 WiCS members to advertise, plan, and teach basic programming in Python, Java, and C over multiple weekend workshops.
