CSED02,"It is hard to have a conversation about the role or potential of technology in education without coming across the term: Computational Thinking (CT). The last decade has seen the term go from a rallying cry from computer scientists to an essential 21st century skill cited in national curricular frameworks and championed as belonging alongside reading, writing and arithmetic as a core instructional goal of education. However, despite its growing prominence and use (or potentially because of it), CT is not without its issues. A lack of clarity on exactly what it is, how it relates to other content areas, and effective ways to assess it all plague those trying to use CT in their research or instruction. This graduate seminar takes a critical look at CT, seeking to understand its historical roots, modern incarnations, and the challenges we still face in working with this amorphous construct."

computer science concepts. Topics include research methodologies used in computer science
education, how novices learn to program, and how technology can engage students in active
learning, facilitate collaboration and enhance traditional educational practice.
There are two major components to this course -- how students learn Computer Science (Computer
Science Education) and how computers can be used to improve learning in all subjects (Computers
in Education).
Computer Science Education is the study of how students learn computing concepts. We look how
novices learn to program, differences between programming languages and environments used in
computer science education, visualization of computing concepts, curriculum design and delivery,
attitudes and diversity in the computing classroom.
Computers in Education is the study of how computers are used to enhance learning. Computers
play an increasingly important role in modern education as tools to communicate knowledge, engage
students in active learning, and facilitate collaboration. We look at different instructional technologies
and how computer software can enhance traditional education practice, including educational games
and tools that support collaboration."

CSED30,"This seminar course explores how tools and technologies can be designed to support learning
computer science in exciting and potentially unexpected ways. We will explore computer
science learning across informal and formal contexts at the K-12 and university level. We will
study the design of programming languages, interest-driven programming activities, and
interactive environments to support learning at scale. We will also explore who is included in
computer science learning, and how tools and technologies can be designed to promote equity.
To guide our exploration we will read and discuss a variety of research papers including:
● Foundational papers that provide tools to help us conceptualize learning in computer
science and unpack the role of tools and technologies in the learning process.
● Papers that provide examples of learning environments for teaching computer science
concepts to show the breadth of design approaches that have been explored.
Students will apply their knowledge of these papers through a quarter-long project on a topic of
their choice, which must involve either the design of a computer science learning environment
or the analysis of a computer science learning environment design. My hope is that students
choose projects that are directly related to their main-line research, such that the project allows
them to practice core research skills while furthering their own research agenda."
CSED31,"I will start this syllabus by saying what this course is not. It does not cover everything that is and ever was
computing education research (CER). That is too big. It is not The Best way to do research for Everyone. This
course is a special topics course of my (Prof. Stephens-Martinez’s) first attempt at introducing CER to
undergraduate students that already know the basics of computing and data analysis. It will focus on some
breadth to give the students in this course an idea of what is in CER. It will also include some depth in what I
know and through my lens of expertise within CER.
The depth part of the course will be me teaching by modeling what depth does and does not look like. I chose th
teaching process because through having one existential proof by example, I hope to show what deeply knowin
topic can look like. However, this does include caveats because the expertise that I show is, as I said, an existen
proof. It does not mean that every representation of expertise will look the same. Moreover, the topics I find
interesting may not be of great interest to everyone in the class. Nor will how I see and view these topics be the
same for another expert. So it is an example as best as I can make that is backed by my expertise."
CSED32,"The course focuses on efforts to broaden participation in CS Education with a primary
emphasis in higher education. The Tuesday homework assignments will involve readings to
develop a breadth of understanding in this area. The Thursday homework assignments will build
towards writing the majority of a formal, conference-style research paper that analyzes student
survey data from the Computing Research Association’s multi-institutional survey data. The core
work of this is conducting a literature review to motivate the study. The final product will include
a full methods section articulating the planned analysis and code (in R, Stata, or SPSS) that
would execute the planned analysis and creation of relevant tables and figures. Based upon the
time constraints of the semester, the analysis of the data will extend beyond the end of the
semester for those students who wish to continue working on the project. Members of the
course are encouraged to work in teams on the paper and are encouraged to connect student
survey data with institutional data. No background is required in computer science or statistics."
CSED33,"This is a seminar for undergraduate teaching assistants. Its main goal is to
help TAs improve their teaching skills by covering topics such as effective grading practices, how
to hold effective office hours, online teaching and learning, and how to communicate well with
students and other course staff. Its secondary goals are to help TAs improve their own
communication skills, leadership skills, and knowledge of computer science as a field, and to
provide TAs a chance to provide feedback to the department."
