As CS Education Coordinator, I managed the following support activities. On this page, I'll link resources that can help others replicate these programs.

## Cohort Enrichment, Year 1

I held three-hour weekly sessions for students in the first year of the CSin3 accelerated degree program. These sessions are focused on skills students need to succeed in college generally and in computer science specifically. Topics covered are:

* Review of fundamental programming skills, using Peer Instruction 
* Academic success skills (time management, essay organization, preparing for exams, etc)
* Culture-building (growth mindset, grit, high expectations)
* Teambuilding
* Self-reflection and career exploration
* Extracurriculuar projects
* Resume writing

The materials for Cohort Enrichment are being compiled on the [Cohort Enrichment Website](https://sites.google.com/a/csumb.edu/fys-cs/) (still incomplete).

## Peer-led Team Learning  

I trained and managed about 30 Peer Leaders each semester, who guide students through weekly Peer-Led Team Learning workshops for introductory computer science courses. In these workshops, 4-10 students solve a challenging packet of problems collaboratively with their classmates, while the Peer Leader facilitates and guides discussion.

View the [CSUMB Peer-Led Team Learning website](https://sites.google.com/a/csumb.edu/cs-pltl/) for more information. A website with all my PLTL materials is in progress.

## TA++ 

I have created an organizational structure for computer science TAs at CSUMB called TA++. A TA++ is a TA...and more. TA++s do typical TA duties, but also come together for weekly training activities focused on more effective methods of supporting somputer science instruction. TA++s for introductory programming classes lead Peer-Led Team Learning sessions in addition to regular TA duties.

Check out the [TA++ website](https://sites.google.com/a/csumb.edu/taplusplus/) for more details. Information about how to replicate the TA++ program is coming soon.

## The teaching advice I give myself

These tips may seem obvious, or maybe they aren't obvious! They are techniques I don't see employed in most computer science courses I work with, but I think they are crucial to my students' success. I would absolutely love to perform research to prove their effectiveness.

#### Memory boxes, memory boxes, memory boxes!

*Every primitive, object, pointer, and function call can be represented in a diagram. I've found that once students have the ability to accurately translate declarations, initializations, and assignments into a corresponding drawing, many misconceptions melt away. I think the process of drawing memory boxes is a great way to get students' mental models on the right track.*

#### Details and precision matter

*It's tempting to gloss over details when talking about coding, but I've found that avoiding precision always comes back to bite me (or rather, the students). Coding is a very precise and detail-oriented endeavor, and as a general rule I find that over-generalized or imprecise answers from students are signs of an incomplete understanding. Requiring precision sets the standard in the right place.*

#### Students should code on paper

*When students need to code on paper, they can't depend on autocomplete. Coding on paper also forces students to test by walking through their code step-by-step, which is great practice for being a human compiler.*

#### Incorporate testing whenever possible

*Testing requires students to walk through their code step-by-step, which exercises their understanding of the mental model behind the code. The process of thinking up new test cases that will break their code creates a great feedback loop for students to improve their work and eventually anticipate common errors.*

#### Don't be afraid to introduce accurate vocabulary

*Students will copy the way you speak about code. Use accurate vocabulary repeatedly and with good context, and students will understand. Don't shy away from words like "declaration", "initialization", "assignment", "compiler", "literal", "identifier", "implementation", etc. If you do, how will students ever understand their error messages? Or how to Google when they run into problems?*
